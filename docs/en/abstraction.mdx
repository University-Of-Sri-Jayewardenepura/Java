# Abstraction

## Definition

Abstraction hides implementation details and exposes only the essential features of an object. It focuses on *what* an object does rather than *how* it does it.

## Abstract Classes

An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly. It can contain both abstract methods (no body) and concrete methods (with body).

```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start();    // abstract — no implementation

    void stop() {             // concrete — has implementation
        System.out.println("Vehicle stopped");
    }
}
```

- Abstract classes can have constructors, fields, and concrete methods.
- A subclass must implement all abstract methods or be declared abstract itself.

## Interfaces

An interface defines a contract — a set of methods that implementing classes must provide.

```java
interface Flyable {
    void fly();  // implicitly public and abstract
}
```

- A class can implement **multiple interfaces** (Java's alternative to multiple inheritance).
- Since Java 8, interfaces can have `default` and `static` methods with implementations.

## Abstraction vs. Encapsulation

| Aspect | Abstraction | Encapsulation |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Focus | Hiding complexity | Hiding data |
| Mechanism | Abstract classes, interfaces | Access modifiers, getters/setters |
| Purpose | Design-level simplification | Implementation-level protection |

## Example

```java
// AbstractionDemo.java
// Demonstrates abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces in Java.

// Abstract class
abstract class Vehicle {
	// Abstract method
	abstract void start();
}

// Concrete subclass
class Car extends Vehicle {
	void start() {
		System.out.println("Car starts with key");
	}
}

// Interface
interface Flyable {
	void fly();
}

// Class implementing interface
class Plane implements Flyable {
	public void fly() {
		System.out.println("Plane is flying");
	}
}

public class AbstractionDemo {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		// Abstract class reference to subclass
		Vehicle v = new Car();
		v.start();

		// Interface reference to implementing class
		Flyable f = new Plane();
		f.fly();
	}
}
```
